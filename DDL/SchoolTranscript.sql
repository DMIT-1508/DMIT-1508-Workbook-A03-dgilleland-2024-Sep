-- Create Tables...
-- 1) Drop any tables that already exist
--    Always drop them in the reverse order
--    that you create them
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS StudentCourses
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Courses
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Students

-- 2) Setup/Create my tables
--    Parent tables before child tables
-- The CREATE TABLE statement in SQL is used to
-- define the schema of a table. This is also
-- referred to as a table definition.
-- A CREATE TABLE statement contains a
-- comma-separated list of column definitions.
